            <p>
              lumohacks is a 24 hour event, which means that you should come prepared to spend the night at the venue. Please bring an ID as well as a student ID if applicable.

            <h2 class="best__title">Can I work on my previous projects?</h2>
            <p>
              No, all projects must start from scratch and built during the time you are at the event. Ideas may be generated beforehand. The rule is strictly enforced at lumohacks and the penalty for a project from before the event is disqualification. However, feel free to use any libraries or tools.

              Unfortunately, we are not able to provide reimbursements for travel or accommodation at the moment. Please look towards future editions of the event as this may become available.

            <p>
              That’s fine, teams can take the amount of time they want to work on their projects. As long as your project is submitted before the deadline, it will be eligible for judging. If your ideas aren’t completely finished by the end and that’s completely fine! Mentors will be at the event to provide feedback.

          <p>
          Teams can be 2-4 people. You may have a bigger team, but your team wouldn’t be eligible for the judging process or prizes. You can still work on a project in a bigger group or receive feedback on the project from mentors at the event.
